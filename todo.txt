What needs to improved/does not work.
- Pagination
- Routing
- Reactively close the modals on successful operation and then refresh data in the main table
- More organized code (move queries to separate modules)
- Table scroll fix
- Logo image
- complete the flows
- Almost everything under "Advanced" section
- fonts
- Need to make cleaner commits for the work (right now a lot of code has leaked between commits)
- Unit tests

What works well:
- Lists
- Interactions on the list
- Modals and general look and feel
- Queries on fetching data and the one create investor mutation
